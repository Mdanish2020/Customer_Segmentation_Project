# Customer_Segmentation_Project
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
In this project, your task is to identify major customer segments on a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

## BUSINESS OBJECTIVE
Customer Segmentation is a most popular and common technique to used by the most of the e-commerce retail companies. In order to increase top line and bottom line of the company, they need to inspect some things where customer segmentation helps a lot.
The goal of segmenting customers is to decide how to relate to customers in each segment in order to maximize the value of each customer to the business.
Main objective is to find the solution of the following questions:

- We want to know who my customers are(belongs to which class)
- What they like to purchase and in what amount they purchase?
- How frequent they purchase?
- When they purchase?(Seasonal, Festivals, occasionally)
- Which products are sold in large amount.

## Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) model to determine customer value:
The RFM model is quite useful model in retail customer segmentation where only the data of customer transaction is available. RFM stands for the three dimensions:

Recency – How recently did the customer purchase? Frequency – How often do they purchase? Monetary Value – How much do they spend? A combination of these three attributes can be defined to assign a quantitative value to customers. e.g. A customer who recently bought high value products and transacts regularly is a high value customer.

## Segmentation with K-means clustering:
Initially, the data is subject to important stages in an analytics pipeline: exploratory analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering and standardizaton. Then, the unsupervised classification technique, K-means clustering algorithm, is used to determine the ideal segments of customers. Silhouette analysis and related cluster visualizations are leveraged to deduce the optimum value of "K" (number of clusters) in the algorithm. The observations from the results are elaborately discussed before reaching the conclusion from the business perspective.

## Conclusion:
- K-Means Clustering with h Elbow Method having WCSS (4000) and Silhouette Score (0.31), we can conclude that optimal clusters are 4..

- Sales has been increased from 2010 to 2011.

- RFM for Cluster ID box plots tells well about Cluster detail.
